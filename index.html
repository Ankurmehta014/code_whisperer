            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Happy Birthday, Sakshi! 🎂🎉,</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Congrats on completing another trip around <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sun! ☀️ I hope you have a birthday <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that's out of this world! 🌍✨ 🎉🎈</p>
            <p>I also wanted to apologize 😔 if any of my actions hurt <br> you. 🤕 I don't know what you might have seen  or heard<br> about me, but I would never intentionally cause you pain. <br> I miss our conversations and the fun times we had.<br>  Thank you for being such an amazing friend. <br> If you don’t want to talk right now, <br> I completely understand, but please don’t be angry with me.😊</p>
            <p>>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wishing you all the best on your birthday <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   and always! 🎈🎁 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   [Gaurav]</p>
